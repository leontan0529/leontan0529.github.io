# Welcome to my GitHub!

This is my attempt with GitHub.io to create my own personal website to introduce myself. Still a beginner with these tools and especially with HTML and CSS. <br>

<br>Please feel free to drop me a direct message if you have any suggestions/feedback! I am currently busy with school so this page will be updated once in a blue moon... <br>
